Income & Expense Tracker

This is a simple Income & Expense Tracker built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
I created this project to practice core frontend concepts such as DOM manipulation, API integration and UI state handling.

The project focuses on understanding how JavaScript works with the DOM in a real application setup.

Features:

1. Add income and expense transactions
2. Switch between Income and Expense tabs
3. Filter transactions by All, Income, or Expense
4. Edit existing transactions
5. Delete transactions with a confirmation popup

Automatic calculation of:
* Total income
* Total expense
* Net balance

6.Clean and readable UI styled using Tailwind CSS

Tech Stack:

1. HTML
2. Tailwind CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Mock API (MockAPI.io)

Note: No frameworks or external JavaScript libraries are used.

What I Learned from This Project:

1. Handling DOM events such as click, submit and change
2. Managing UI states like modals, tabs and filters
3. Making API calls using the fetch API
4. Implementing CRUD operations
5. Updating the UI dynamically without page reloads
6. Writing JavaScript in a structured but beginner-friendly way

How the Application Works:

1. The user adds a transaction through a popup form
2. Data is stored and retrieved from a mock API
3. Transactions are rendered into a table
4. Filters and tabs control which transactions are shown
5.Summary widgets update automatically based on data
